# Triggers

## Scheduled executions

If the executions should run in a regular interval, the `schedule` attribute can be set inside the [workflow definition](../registry/definitions/workflowDefinition.md) to a fitting cron value.

## Manual executions

You can also execute a workflow through a button in the UI
