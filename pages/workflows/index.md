# 3. Workflows

Workflows are a combination of Functions and other Workflows. They can be ordered in a so-called [Directed Acyclic Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Directed_acyclic_graph) and like Functions have an interface (inputs and outputs). They can be invoked on a regular basis or by api calls through [Triggers](https://google.com)
